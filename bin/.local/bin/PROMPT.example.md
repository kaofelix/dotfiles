# Ralph Loop Example Prompt

This is an example PROMPT.md file for use with `ralph-pi`.

## Instructions

Each iteration, you should:

1. Read the current state of the project
2. Identify the next logical task
3. Execute that task
4. Update any necessary documentation

## Current Task

Start by exploring the project structure and understanding what needs to be done.

## Context

- Work systematically through the task
- When you complete a sub-task, update this PROMPT.md file to reflect the new state
- If you encounter an error or blocker, document it here
- Always leave the project in a working state

## Notes

- Ralph loops run indefinitely until stopped with Ctrl+C
- Each iteration gets a fresh read of this file
- The agent learns from previous iterations by updating this file
- Think of this as your "sign next to the slide" - directions that guide behavior
